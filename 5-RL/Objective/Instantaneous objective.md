> **Instantaneous objective** - a value of [[Goal|Objective]] function for a ==certain== (frozen) moment of time.
>
> It can be deterministic: $\rho: \mathbb{X} \times \mathbb{U} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$^[$\mathbb{X}$ is [[State x|State space]], $\mathbb{U}$ is [[Input u|Action space]]]
>
> Or a random variable from a PDF, conditioned on $X_t$ and $U_t$ ^[$X_t$ and $U_t$ are random variables as in [[MDP system|Markov decision process]]]

It's also known as ==*reward*==, *utility* (when maximized)

or ==*running cost*==, *instantaneous cost*, *stage* (when minimized)

#SEMINAR-1 Come up with [[Instantaneous objective]]s for system examples from this lecture
